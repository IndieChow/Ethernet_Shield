Component Placing: 10/10%

Notes: The Ethernet Port has to hang from the edge of the PCB so that it's easy to add and remove the ethernet cable. I won't dock any points but try to fix that please. 


Layers and Grounding: 5/10%

Notes: Please add a GND via for all the SMD GND pads. If you are confused, message me.
